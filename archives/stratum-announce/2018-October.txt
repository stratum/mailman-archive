Dear Stratum Community!

As you know, ONF Connect 2018 <https://www.opennetworking.org/onf-connect/>
will take place on Tuesday, December 4 - Thursday, December 6 at the
Marriott Santa Clara, Marriott.

Purpose of this "get together" is to look at all ONF projects globally in
the morning sessions and have very targeted Stratum-related content in the
afternoon(s). A high level agenda can be found here
<https://www.opennetworking.org/onf-connect/agenda/>.


Our goal is to bring all members of the Stratum community together to
network, socialize, as well as discuss topics such as:


   -

   New data plane capabilities enabled by Stratum (led by Barefoot and
   Juniper)
   -

   ODM supplier experiences to date integrating Stratum (led by Delta)
   -

   Testing of Stratum-enabled devices (led by Google)


   -

   P4 pipelines and programs (led by Cisco, Mellanox, and DT)


   -

   Strategy and use cases for deployment (from NTT, DT, and Google)


We are hoping you will register
<https://www.eiseverywhere.com/ereg/newreg.php?eventid=356349> for this
community get together and show your support of our project. On another
note, if you will be attending from out of town, the hotel rate of
$279/night will go up after Nov 20, 2018 (travel sites show the nightly
rate at $533/night!!!) and rooms are limited. You can reserve your room
here.

We hope to see you there!


Brian


P.S. If you have any suggestions about other topics for informal
discussions, let me know, and I can see if we can fit them in somewhere.

Subject: [stratum-announce] Stratum Project Welcomes 3 New Members!
Message-ID: <CACKOpDk1V-mt_-SKGYWUi=wOQ86m86CZAL8jMq_cm_sPA+hz4Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

The Stratum project has recently added 3 new Stratum members:
[image: image.png][image: image.png][image: image.png]

These members along with our 20 existing member companies are working
towards two major milestones for 2018: (1) a demo of Stratum at ONF Connect
<https://www.opennetworking.org/onf-connect/>, and (2) an alpha release of
Stratum to the Stratum membership that will support both hardware and
software reference targets (i.e. exiting the pioneering phase).

If you are interested in joining the project, you can reach out to me or
Bill Snow (cc'ed).

Thanks,
Brian
