Hi all,

You might have seen the new calendar invite for the weekly TST call.

Agenda and Meeting Notes
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ret8Vbnl-xbLgNsnDEH-jWP2_WwDYym4zDn6me3tiTA/edit

The plan is to reserve the *1st and 3rd Thursdays* of each month for
presentations and community updates. If you can only attend some of these
meetings, those will be more interesting. The other meetings will be more
informal sync ups to discuss current issues, progress, and status. You can
see what presentations are planned by checking the agenda above.

The first meeting in this new time slot will be a "3rd Thursday," and the
plan is to review the Stratum Q1 Roadmap.

The meetings are now on Zoom:

If you would like to be added to a future agenda or to the meeting invite,
please let me know.

Thanks!
Brian
