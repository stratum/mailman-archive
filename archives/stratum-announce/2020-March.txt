Dear ONF supporter,

We would like to cordially invite you to participate in the *ONF Community
Meetup 2020 - Europe!*

Dates: *June 2-3, 2020 (Tuesday 10am – Wednesday 4pm)*
Host/Location: *KPN, Maanplein 55, The Hague, The Netherlands*

The theme of the event is *The Status of Open Source Networking in
Production*.

Building on the successful events of June 2018 in Darmstadt and June 2019
in Berlin, the agenda of this two-day event will cover these major areas:

   - Operator updates
   - ONF project and portfolio overviews
   - Infrastructure and SDN projects (ONOS, Stratum, P4, etc.)
   - Broadband (SEBA, VOLTHA)
   - Mobile & Edge Cloud

In each area, you will be hearing about operator updates (roadmaps, trials,
deployments, and experiences), collaborative community proceedings, and
supplier and technology updates.


*Please register here

by May 18th, 2020*. Attendance is free of charge.


Do you have something exciting to present? Kindly let us know by *Monday,
April 20th* (the earlier, the better) if you are interested in *presenting*.
Just reply-all to this email.

*After taking into account the latest status on the evolving COVID-19
situation in Europe, we will communicate a final Go/No-go for this meetup
by April 30th, 2020*. We encourage you to register now, but suggest you
wait until then before making non-refundable travel plans.

Please feel free to forward this invitation to your colleagues – the event
is open to all interested parties (however, to ensure diverse audience, we
may limit participation to five persons from any single organization).

We look forward to seeing you in The Hague!

Warm regards on behalf of KPN and ONF,

Hello,

Due to the worsening coronavirus situation, ONF, in consultation with KPN,
has decided to *cancel* the in-person *ONF Community Meetup 2020 - Europe*
at this time. We are exploring new ways to keep the community engaged and
get the planned content to you, so stay tuned for further announcements
down the road.

With best regards,
