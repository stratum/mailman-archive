<PRE>We are pleased to announce the Stratum *2021-06-30* release (or *21.06* for
short).

This release is chock full of features and fixes for Stratum's Intel
Barefoot Tofino target, including support for two new SDE revisions,
deflect on drop, and initial experimental support for QoS.

Stratum Tofino packages now include BSP support for the Wedge100BF, and
users on those targets can select between the BSP or the JSON port mapping
at startup. The JSON port mapping remains the standard approach that
Stratum uses on all existing Tofino targets. The BSP provides better
support for optical transceivers and supports additional hardware like
gearboxes and retimers. We expect to increase the number of platforms that
offer BSP support in future releases, and we encourage vendors to work with
us to package their BSPs in Stratum.

In this release, Stratum now has support for finer grained control over
logging via gNMI (see the release notes for more details). Stratum no
longer listens for gRPC connections on port 28000 by default; users need to
migrate to the registered IANA ports: 9339 for gNMI and 9559 for P4Runtime.

Pre-built Docker images and Debian packages, along with a more extensive
changelist, are available in the GitHub release page:

Enjoy!
Brian, Max, Yi and the rest of the Stratum team
