Hi everyone,

We would like to congratulate the new members of the Stratum TST for 2020!
They will be responsible for overseeing and managing the Stratum project
for the coming year.

*Stratum TST*
Brian O’Connor (lead)
Alireza Ghaffarkhah (incumbent)
Craig Stevens (new)
Max Pudelko (new)
Yi Tseng (new)

We also want to thank Antonin Bas, our (now officially) retired member for
his service to the TST.

Thanks!
Brian

P.S. If you are wondering why you didn't receive a ballot, that is because
we had 3 open slots and 3 qualified nominees. An election would have just
been a formality, so we decided to skip it.
