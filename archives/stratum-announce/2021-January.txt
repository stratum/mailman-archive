Subject: [stratum-announce] Stratum User Survey
Message-ID: <CACKOpDk4Nn1K-fZBmVi_Lj_ymaEuGYM6sKHxgDm5rQRdpzMRzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Stratum users,

The ONF is gathering information to build a better census of the Stratum
user community. This survey should only take a few minutes, and it will
help prioritize how the ONF team and broader Stratum developer community
allocate their time and resources over the coming year.

Please take a moment to help us shape the future of Stratum:

Thanks in advance!
Brian and the Stratum team

Upcoming Stratum Techinar
Virtual Event January 26, 2021
9am San Francisco | 12pm New York | 6pm Berlin

ONF is excited to host the first of a series of webinars focused on specific ONF projects. These virtual sessions will be technically focused, with presentations by project leads covering roadmap details and latest updates. Attendees will also have the opportunity to ask questions and engage with project leadership during a Q&A section. The first techinar will concentrate on Stratum <https://opennetworking.org/stratum/>, an open source silicon-independent switch operating system for software defined networks, and will be led by Brian O'Connor, the Stratum project technical lead. 


Over the past year, Stratum has continued to mature and find new users. It is a critical layer in the Aether <https://aetherproject.org/> platform and is a key enabler for programming, controlling, and verifying the Pronto <https://prontoproject.org/> dataplane. Stratum is also being used to develop commercial solutions for data center and telco networks, some of which are in trials and production. During this virtual event, we will discuss a few example Stratum use cases and highlight some of its key benefits. We'll also cover highlights from the three 2020 Stratum releases, including new features added and next steps in the Stratum roadmap. 

Register here <https://onf.zoom.us/webinar/register/7116112676453/WN_Y_TVHSafQxeR21i_5OynFQ> for the techinar.
