We are pleased to announce the Stratum *2021-03-31* release (or *21.03* for
short).

Stratum now leverages the new P5 (*Predictive* Programming
Protocol-Independent Packet Processors) language which infers the packet
pipeline based on control plane requirements. On the hardware side, we've
added support for neural wave transponders for direct brain to Stratum
connections.

Pre-built Docker images and Debian packages, along with a more extensive
changelist, are available in the GitHub release page:
https://github.com/stratum/stratum/releases/tag/2021-03-31

This release includes commits from 3 new contributors from the Stratum
community: David Gengenbach, Narada Hess, and Rich Renner.

Enjoy!
Brian, Max, Yi and the rest of the Stratum team

Hi everyone,

We've gotten some questions about the release highlights paragraph of this
announcement (namely, P5 and neural wave transponders); this was a
joke for April
Fools' Day <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day>.

The release itself and the rest of the announcement are legitimate. Here
are the actual release highlights:

This release contains many bug fixes and new features for Stratum running
on Intel Tofino, including support for meter entries, remote *bfshell* for
debugging, basic port shaping configuration, and P4Runtime read
improvements. The Stratum Tofino simulator can now be used in Mininet for
development and testing. Stratum has been updated to the P4Runtime 1.3.0
specification (however, it is not fully compliant with some of the new
semantics, which the Stratum community hopes to address in the next
release). Several gNMI paths in the *interfaces* model have been improved
to return consistent values. The 21.03 release is also the first release of
Stratum that has been (almost entirely) automated.

Thanks!
Brian
