Subject: [stratum-announce] Stratum is Open Source!
Message-ID: <CACKOpDmdRHP1obTAa3CrHEKDwehjkt_NLWiJV72Ac_LcGaub4A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,


A few weeks ago at ONF Connect, the Stratum community announced
<https://www.opennetworking.org/news-and-events/press-releases/onf-announces-stratum-project-now-available-as-open-source-completes-incubation-development/>
that the project is now open source.

Here are some of the talks from the event that focused on Stratum:

Next-Gen SDN Stack Plenary at ONF Connect 19 <https://vimeo.com/359680444>

Stratum Overview & Update at ONF Connect 19 <https://vimeo.com/360359821>

Additional Next-GEN SDN sessions from ONF Connect 19
<https://www.opennetworking.org/onf-connect-2019-resources/>

To help you get started, we have two basic tutorials that walk through how
to start Stratum in Mininet as well as how to connect it to ONOS and run
Trellis: https://github.com/stratum/tutorial

To learn more about Stratum's northbound interfaces (P4Runtime, gNMI and
gNOI), you can try out the NG-SDN tutorial:
https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/ngsdn-tutorial

If you are interested in looking into the source code, Stratum is now
public: https://github.com/stratum/stratum

Stratum uses Github for source management, issue tracking and pull
requests, so file bugs, request features, and submit patches on Github.

The Stratum Technical Steering Team holds a weekly meeting that oscillates
between Wednesday at 4:30pm and Thursday at 10:00am Pacific time. You can
add the Stratum calendar to see upcoming meetings and events: web view
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=opennetworking.org_vv3lft89e794b4jlmr3j9p1pes%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles>,
ICS format
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/opennetworking.org_vv3lft89e794b4jlmr3j9p1pes%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics>
(for Outlook, iCal, Google Calendar, etc.).

If you have questions, we maintain a mailing list
<https://lists.stratumproject.org/listinfo/stratum-dev> and Slack workspace
<https://slackin.stratumproject.org>.

Thanks, and looking forward to your (continued) participation!

Subject: [stratum-announce] Stepping down from Stratum TST
Message-ID: <CAAkB0aAkRptJPNaMrA4PqAki8TZ8nXZ6JgqzOUv3t61nSqD-5w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Stratum community,

As some of you may know, I recently moved from Barefoot Networks / Intel to
VMware. While I will be able to stay involved in the P4.org community and
in particular the P4 API Working Group (which maintains the P4Runtime API),
I will not be able to keep the same level of involvement in other ONF
projects and in particular Stratum. While I intend to keep contributing to
bmv2 and the bmv2 Stratum integration, it will mostly be on my own time.
Given this, I feel it is better and only fair that I step down from the
Stratum TST, and leave my spot to someone who will be more involved in the
project and foster involvement from his employer. I let Brian know about my
decision a couple of weeks ago. My understanding is that there will be a
new TST election in the near future as part of the Stratum open-sourcing.
It has been a real pleasure to serve on the TST and I sincerely hope I can
stay involved in the project.

Best,

Antonin
