Hi everyone,

I am happy to announce the availability of TestVectors.

There are two parts:

   1. A set of initial test cases (called TestVectors) for bmv2, Broadcom
   Tomahawk, and Barefoot Tofino targets:
   https://github.com/stratum/testvectors
   2. A runner that can be used to put a target switch under test:
   https://github.com/stratum/testvectors-runner

We will be working to integrate TestVectors into Stratum CI system to
enable system test coverage of software and hardware switches. TestVectors
are also useful vehicles for operators to formally specify requirements.

To learn more, you can watch a few talks on TestVectors:

   - Introduction and Rationale  (Alireza Ghaffarkhah & Tomek Madejski)
   https://vimeo.com/307167637/e1117a14ac
   - Architecture and Implementation Details (Abhilash Endurthi & You Wang)
   https://vimeo.com/361225907 (slides
   <https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3.00pm-Abhilash-Endurthi-Test-Vectors.pdf>
   )

If you have any questions or want to contribute, please join the *#test*
channel on the Stratum Slack <https://stratumproject.slack.com> (or invite
yourself <https://slackin.stratumproject.org/> if you aren't already on
Slack). You can also direct questions at the dev mailing list:
*stratum-dev at lists.stratumproject.org
<stratum-dev at lists.stratumproject.org>*

Finally, a big thank you to Ali, Devjit, Tomek and team at Google for
kicking things off, and to Abhilash and You at ONF for bringing this to
open source.

Thanks!
Brian

Congrats to everyone in the ONF team who worked on this!
It would be great for these tests to be unified across targets as much
as possible in the future - or at least have a solid core of common tests.
