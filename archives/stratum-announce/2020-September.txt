We are pleased to announce the second Stratum release: *2020-09-30* (or
20.09 for short)

Pre-built Docker images and Debian packages, along with a more extensive
changelist, is available in the GitHub release page:

This release supports P4Runtime v1.2.0 and gNMI v0.7.0 on several targets
<https://github.com/stratum/stratum/tree/2020-09-30#supported-devices>.
Stratum's date-named releases are scheduled to happen quarterly, but they
may be more or less frequent if needed.

Thanks again to everyone that has participated in this release!
Brian, Max, Yi and the rest of the Stratum team
