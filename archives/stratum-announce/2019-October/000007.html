<PRE>Hi Stratum community,

As some of you may know, I recently moved from Barefoot Networks / Intel to
VMware. While I will be able to stay involved in the P4.org community and
in particular the P4 API Working Group (which maintains the P4Runtime API),
I will not be able to keep the same level of involvement in other ONF
projects and in particular Stratum. While I intend to keep contributing to
bmv2 and the bmv2 Stratum integration, it will mostly be on my own time.
Given this, I feel it is better and only fair that I step down from the
Stratum TST, and leave my spot to someone who will be more involved in the
project and foster involvement from his employer. I let Brian know about my
decision a couple of weeks ago. My understanding is that there will be a
new TST election in the near future as part of the Stratum open-sourcing.
It has been a real pleasure to serve on the TST and I sincerely hope I can
stay involved in the project.

Best,

Antonin
