&gt;<i> Hi Stratum community,

</I>&gt;<i> As some of you may know, I recently moved from Barefoot Networks / Intel
</I>&gt;<i> to VMware. While I will be able to stay involved in the P4.org community
</I>&gt;<i> and in particular the P4 API Working Group (which maintains the P4Runtime
</I>&gt;<i> API), I will not be able to keep the same level of involvement in other ONF
</I>&gt;<i> projects and in particular Stratum. While I intend to keep contributing to
</I>&gt;<i> bmv2 and the bmv2 Stratum integration, it will mostly be on my own time.
</I>&gt;<i> Given this, I feel it is better and only fair that I step down from the
</I>&gt;<i> Stratum TST, and leave my spot to someone who will be more involved in the
</I>&gt;<i> project and foster involvement from his employer. I let Brian know about my
</I>&gt;<i> decision a couple of weeks ago. My understanding is that there will be a
</I>&gt;<i> new TST election in the near future as part of the Stratum open-sourcing.
</I>&gt;<i> It has been a real pleasure to serve on the TST and I sincerely hope I can
</I>&gt;<i> stay involved in the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
