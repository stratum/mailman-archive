Happy New Year!

Our first scheduled meeting of the year is scheduled for:
Thursday, January 9⋅10:00 – 10:30am PST

New Year, New Call?

   1.  There is a proposal for a new call time: Wed. 11:30am PST (San
   Francisco) / 8:30pm CET (Berlin) / Thurs 6:30am AEDT (Sydney). Are there
   any objections to this time slot? (during the summer months, we might adopt
   a different time)
   2. Meeting cadence: We currently have this meeting weekly. The thinking
   is to make the 1st and 3rd Wednesdays as larger meetings with scheduled
   presentations, and the other meetings more like sync-up / stand ups that
   are about going over current status and issues. Thoughts?
   3. Moving to Zoom. Be on the lookout for a new conferencing link in the
   calendar invite.

If there are no objections on the new time, we can move this week's
meeting. If there are any concerns, we can keep the previously scheduled
time and discuss on Thursday.

Thanks!
Brian

Message-ID: <CACKOpDmrgL1mdykt2pFuZP5OYuUB8D7LjZZN0oc-kOg03vuaOA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

You might have seen the new calendar invite for the weekly TST call.

Agenda and Meeting Notes
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ret8Vbnl-xbLgNsnDEH-jWP2_WwDYym4zDn6me3tiTA/edit

The plan is to reserve the *1st and 3rd Thursdays* of each month for
presentations and community updates. If you can only attend some of these
meetings, those will be more interesting. The other meetings will be more
informal sync ups to discuss current issues, progress, and status. You can
see what presentations are planned by checking the agenda above.

The first meeting in this new time slot will be a "3rd Thursday," and the
plan is to review the Stratum Q1 Roadmap.

For Supporting Slides and Previous Recordings,

The meetings are now on Zoom:

If you would like to be added to a future agenda or to the meeting invite,
please let me know.

Thanks!
Brian

plan is to reserve the 1st and 3rd Thursdays of each month for  
presentations and community updates. If you can only attend some of these  
meetings, those will be more interesting. The other meetings will be more  
informal&nbsp;sync ups to discuss current issues, progress, and status. You  
can see what presentations are planned by checking the agenda
