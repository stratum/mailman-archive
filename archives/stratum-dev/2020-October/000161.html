<PRE>Thanks, Max,
Static linking is fine by me ðŸ˜Š

I very much like your SDE linkage idea. What confuses me is whether this is strictly a link issue, or a runtime initialization issue. The error (seen at run-time after much SDE init has been done) indicates that someone is trying to add the same file that has already been added. (Not sure whether the SDE or stratum got there first.)

What I have not yet determined is whether this is some kind of internal thing that the single linkage would somehow solve, or whether there is some kind of init/instantiation code that we would have to find and disable.

Actually, it might be a bit trickier, since the init would only need to be disabled if building stratum with an SDE that has BFRT enabled. Else of course you need it (since the SDE would not be doing it). And would there be some kind of handle that the SDE and stratum code would need to share?

If you are interested in solving this problem, I would love to discuss the details. Iâ€™d like to solve this in an appropriate generally-applicable way. N

That does indeed sound like a lot of work.

I didnâ€™t find any instances of dlopen()
This is correct. We don't participate in such heretic practices, but instead build a single, fat and beautiful binary, like
the apostles from Bell Labs intended :D

On a more serious note, I wonder if we could link in the gRPC libraries from the SDE, instead of our own.
Export them in bfsde.BUILD as cc_libraries and search-and-replace every instance throughout the code base.

I googled it and found lots of references to â€˜protobuf File already exists in databaseâ€™. There were various ideas, but the common solution in all threads was to factor out the code using protobuf into a separate library for use by both modules.

Sure I can re-factor my own code, but refactoring protobuf out of stratum and BF-SDE into a separate dynamic library, thatâ€™s a lot bigger project! And probably not advisable.

There were other suggestions like using dlopen() with RLTD_GLOBAL and linking with -fvisibility=hidden. I didnâ€™t find any instances of dlopen() in the stratum code, and bazel seems only to support hints about linking, not fine-grained options.

So scratching my head about this right now. N

Thanks for the update.

I think if you use bazel run directly on the switch, all the shared libraries should be taken care of by Bazel.

To my knowledge, nobody had success running both gRPC services at the same time yet. We internally tried a while ago,
but hit the same roadblocks as you.

Thanks Max,
Setting linkstatic to False results in a set of missing libraries. I am using compatible versions of grpc and protobuf, so that is not the issue.

Has anyone reported being able to run stratum with the Barefoot SDE BFRT server enabled?

I have not thus far solved the issue of the duplicate references (protobuf, etc). Thanks, N

Hi Narada,

Bazel heavily favors static linking, but there are some options around that: <A HREF="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/c-cpp.html#cc_binary.linkstatic&lt;https://nam05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.bazel.build%2Fversions%2Fmaster%2Fbe%2Fc-cpp.html%23cc_binary.linkstatic&amp;data=02%7C01%7CNHESS%40extremenetworks.com%7C6679c3b9c8f24bca4bb808d86fbd47fb%7Cfc8c2bf6914d4c1fb35246a9adb87030%7C0%7C0%7C637382206046130538&amp;sdata=qZJ4MYk2ydibLX6pJV%2BsiqjuwxN1CbrJENVcVytqj4w%3D&amp;reserved=0">https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/c-cpp.html#cc_binary.linkstatic&lt;https://nam05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.bazel.build%2Fversions%2Fmaster%2Fbe%2Fc-cpp.html%23cc_binary.linkstatic&amp;data=02%7C01%7CNHESS%40extremenetworks.com%7C6679c3b9c8f24bca4bb808d86fbd47fb%7Cfc8c2bf6914d4c1fb35246a9adb87030%7C0%7C0%7C637382206046130538&amp;sdata=qZJ4MYk2ydibLX6pJV%2BsiqjuwxN1CbrJENVcVytqj4w%3D&amp;reserved=0</A>&gt;
Try adding this label on the stratum_bf target and rebuild.
Another potential source of problems could be the different versions of gRPC and Protobuf between Stratum and the SDE. Adjusting it in Stratum is as
easy as swapping the urls in the deps.bzl file.

Hi,
Iâ€™m trying to build stratum_bf with the BF SDE BF-Runtime server enabled. That requires building the SDE with gRPC. Of course, when I try to run stratum_bf, it crashes because of the two instances of the gRPC library (see below).

Is there any way to build stratum_bf with dynamic linking of the gRPC (and protobuf too, Iâ€™m guessing) library? I saw half a dozen files in the bazel directory referencing gRPC. Just removing the references of course did not work.

Thanks for any suggestions on how to proceed. N
