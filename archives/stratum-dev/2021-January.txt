Subject: [stratum-dev] Developer Economics Survey is now open
Message-ID: <CACZfwXuQhgsab4TDEGA+sf+pxorPGS7zhZyNsP9AUtnZLRg_PQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey ONF Developer Community!

What will 2021 be like for developers like you? In order to better
understand and improve our developer communities, ONF has partnered with
SlashData in creating the Developer Economics survey. This is actually the
20th edition of this global SlashData survey where you can share your views
about programming languages, tools, platforms, technologies, and frameworks.

What's in it for you? Everyone who signs up and completes the survey will
get a virtual goodie bag packed with resources and data to help you develop
your skills and improve your career. You will also enter a prize draw worth
$17,000+ where you could win a Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus, Acer Predator
Helios 300 Gaming Laptop, JetBrains All Products license, gear for your
workstation, swag, Amazon vouchers, and more. There are also cash prizes
worth up to $1,000 if you invite other developers to take part.

For every completed response, SlashData is donating money to the Black
Girls Code organization. The goal is to reach $2,000 in donation, so help
them out by taking the survey.

The survey closes on February 8th, so please don't delay!

Take the survey <https://developereconomics.net/?member_id=onf> (note that
in order to win prizes you will have to Sign Up, but if that is of no
interest to you, you can take the survey without signing up).

Subject: [stratum-dev] Stratum User Survey
Message-ID: <CACKOpDk4Nn1K-fZBmVi_Lj_ymaEuGYM6sKHxgDm5rQRdpzMRzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Stratum users,

The ONF is gathering information to build a better census of the Stratum
user community. This survey should only take a few minutes, and it will
help prioritize how the ONF team and broader Stratum developer community
allocate their time and resources over the coming year.

Please take a moment to help us shape the future of Stratum:

Thanks in advance!
Brian and the Stratum team

Subject: [stratum-dev] Questions about OVS, FPM, and supported hardware
Message-ID: <CAM-ym_dYqGXpcoMOn3JFcPK+keCx5G5Br2uhZTcL53YeQQrHGA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Stratum guys,
                          I'm not sure of the right forum to ask these
questions, so it would be great if you could provide suggestions (I did
ping a few contacts listed on the repo, but no replies as yet, so I'm
posting it here). Can you kindly provide feedback to the following:

1. From the documentation on your github repo (in addition to tutorials and
presentations), it appears that the BMv2 is the virtual switch supported.
Does Stratum also support OVS (Or any other production grade virtual
switch?)? If not, is this on the roadmap?

2. From Brian's presentation in 2019 (https://youtu.be/I83VdrZtkyM), he
mentioned that the Stratum FPM compiler does not support MPLS and QinQ. Can
you kindly share documentation about what all is supported?

3.  Is support for Broadcom's D7264 on the roadmap?

Thanks!
-Syd

Hi Syd,

Thanks for your questions! I've provided some answers inline.

Stratum does not support OVS or any production grade software switch for
now. We have some community members that have been looking into this, and
there are a few promising options. Support for a production grade switch is
not on the official roadmap at this point, but we would certainly welcome a
community contribution in this area!

Sorry that this isn't spelled out in a README. The FPM compiler only
applies to the Broadcom target. For bmv2 and Tofino, you can use MPLS,
QinQ, and everything else that you can express in P4 and compile using the
bmv2 and Tofino compilers.

Here is a list of the supported pipeline stages for Broadcom:
https://github.com/stratum/stratum/blob/master/stratum/public/proto/p4_annotation.proto

Here is a list of the supported tables and entry types for Broadcom:
https://github.com/stratum/stratum/blob/master/stratum/public/proto/p4_table_defs.proto

If you need a new features to FPM, I would highly recommend this talk:
P4 on FPM Switches with Stratum Max Pudelko (ONF) Slides
<https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3.30pm-Max-Pudelko-Stratum-FPM-Compiler.pdf>
, Video <https://vimeo.com/360365536>
and this document:
https://github.com/stratum/stratum/blob/master/stratum/docs/extenting_stratum_bcm.md

 Are you referring to the Inventec D7264 switch? If so, you'd have to check
with Inventec for specifics, but they might be working on it.

It's a Broadcom Tomahawk 2 switch that should be supported by the Stratum
OpenNSA target.
