Hey ONF Developer Community!

What will 2021 be like for developers like you? In order to better
understand and improve our developer communities, ONF has partnered with
SlashData in creating the Developer Economics survey. This is actually the
20th edition of this global SlashData survey where you can share your views
about programming languages, tools, platforms, technologies, and frameworks.

What's in it for you? Everyone who signs up and completes the survey will
get a virtual goodie bag packed with resources and data to help you develop
your skills and improve your career. You will also enter a prize draw worth
$17,000+ where you could win a Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus, Acer Predator
Helios 300 Gaming Laptop, JetBrains All Products license, gear for your
workstation, swag, Amazon vouchers, and more. There are also cash prizes
worth up to $1,000 if you invite other developers to take part.

For every completed response, SlashData is donating money to the Black
Girls Code organization. The goal is to reach $2,000 in donation, so help
them out by taking the survey.

The survey closes on February 8th, so please don't delay!

Take the survey &lt;<A HREF="https://developereconomics.net/?member_id=onf">https://developereconomics.net/?member_id=onf</A>&gt; (note that
in order to win prizes you will have to Sign Up, but if that is of no
interest to you, you can take the survey without signing up).
