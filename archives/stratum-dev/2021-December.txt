Hi Luciano, 

There is some documentation here:
https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/ODTN-emulator/blob/master/docs/run_onos.md <https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/ODTN-emulator/blob/master/docs/run_onos.md> 

I’ve added the stratum mailing list and a few folks at ONF that have worked with the cassini’s

Quick question on the working CASSINI. Did you follow our documentation ? Is there anything you’d like to add ? Feel free to submit a PR with all the things you needed to have them working.

Thanks, 
Andrea Campanella
