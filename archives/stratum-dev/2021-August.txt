plan is to reserve the 1st and 3rd Thursdays of each month for  
presentations and community updates. If you can only attend some of these  
meetings, those will be more interesting. The other meetings will be more  
informal&nbsp;sync ups to discuss current issues, progress, and status. You

Subject: [stratum-dev] Control Plane API for Runtime Programmablility
	(FlexCore)
Message-ID: <CAAkB0aAX+0g=iKpMGYKDhi10VGyrNjJLbpiFw0JmJ1Q0mZKqew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am happy to announce that Ang Chen from Rice University will present his
work on FlexCore at the next P4 API Working Group meeting, on Friday August
27th, at 9.30AM PST. Ang and his co-authors are proposing a new set of
runtime APIs for P4, to enable live device reconfiguration with no down
time. The FlexCore paper will appear at NSDI'22.

Please find the abstract for the talk below, along with the meeting
details. I hope to see many of you at the talk. Please share this with
anyone you think might be interested.

Thanks,

Antonin

-- Title: Control Plane API for Runtime Programmablility (FlexCore)

-- Abstract: The current P4 ecosystem primarily targets compile-time
programming of network devices, but runtime device reconfigurations in real
time have not received sufficient attention. This unfortunately
restricts the velocity of change: reprogramming a P4 device incurs
intrusive change as it requires a complete reflash. In a production
network, such reconfigurations need to be carefully planned, e.g., via
network management procedures such as draining and rerouting traffic from
the target node, re-imaging the data plane, and redirecting traffic back to
its original route. FlexCore investigates design techniques for runtime
programmable targets, and proposes target-independent control plane API for
runtime programming of network devices. Our proposed API is generally
applicable to P4-based switch ASICs, programmable NICs, and software
targets, and our current implementation is for a merchant silicon based
upon the Nvidia Spectrum-2 SN3300 series. This new API enables partial
reconfiguration of programmable data planes at runtime with minimum
resource overheads, without service disruption, while processing packets
with consistency guarantees. The full design will be presented at NSDI
2022, and this talk focuses on the implications for the P4Runtime design.
This is joint work from a group of academic and industry researchers:
Jiarong Xing, Kuo-Feng Hsu (Rice), Matty Kadosh, Alan Lo, Yonathan
Piasetzky (Nvidia), Arvind Krishnamurthy (UW), Ang Chen (Rice).
