<PRE>Hello ONF developers and contributors,

ONF is happy to announce that it is moving to an automated system for
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) management. This will make it easier
for you to create and manage your Individual and Institutional (Corporate)
CLAs. It requires you to take action - log into the CLA Manager
&lt;<A HREF="https://cla.opennetworking.org/">https://cla.opennetworking.org/</A>&gt;, sign a CLA, and add the email and/or
GitHub user identities you use to contribute source code. Please sign the
CLA and add these identities &lt;<A HREF="https://cla.opennetworking.org/">https://cla.opennetworking.org/</A>&gt; before April
1, 2020. Starting April 1st, you will not be able to make contributions
through GitHub or Gerrit unless you have a valid CLA in place.

More about CLAs:

   -

   A CLA is a legal document in which a contributor states that they are
   entitled to contribute the code/documentation/translation to the project
   and are willing to have it used in distributions and derivative works.
   Should there be any kind of legal issue in the future regarding the origins
   and ownership of any particular piece of code, the project will have the
   necessary forms on file from the contributor(s) saying they were permitted
   to make this contribution.
   -

   The CLA also ensures that once a contributor has provided a
   contribution, they cannot try to withdraw permission for its use at a later
   date. People and companies can therefore use that software, confident that
   they will not be asked to stop using pieces of the code at a later date.
   -

   Whenever a non-ONF contributor wants to submit a contribution to an ONF
   open source project, they must first sign a CLA. This allows the
   contributor to retain their ownership in the code submitted while granting
   ONF the necessary legal rights to use and relicense that contribution. The
   CLA only needs to be signed once and it covers all unrestricted Apache 2.0
   ONF projects.


Note that there are two types of CLAs - Individual and Institutional
(Corporate). Most source code contributions made to ONF projects are made
on behalf of developers working for corporations that hold copyright to
those contributions. You will need to know your companyâ€™s process to
authorize making open source contributions - in some cases, if your company
has an existing membership or partner relationship with ONF, this
authorization might have already been given. The CLA Manager
&lt;<A HREF="https://cla.opennetworking.org/">https://cla.opennetworking.org/</A>&gt; will ask you if you have the authority to
sign your CLA. If you do, you should sign the Individual CLA. However, if
you do not, the CLA Manager &lt;<A HREF="https://cla.opennetworking.org/">https://cla.opennetworking.org/</A>&gt; suggests a
sample email you should send to the person who has this authority. The
authorized person should then sign the Institutional CLA and add your email
and/or GitHub user identities to the Institutional CLA.

You can find additional information about the ONF CLA process here

<A HREF="https://lists.stratumproject.org/listinfo/stratum-dev">help at opennetworking.org.</A>

Finally, please take a few moments now to sign your CLA in the ONF CLA
Manager &lt;<A HREF="https://cla.opennetworking.org/">https://cla.opennetworking.org/</A>&gt;.

With best regards,

--
