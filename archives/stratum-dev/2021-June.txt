Hi Kevin,

> Q1
No, Stratum is unrelated to OFAGENT.

> Q2
Yes, completely normal. Stratum started successfully and is now waiting for
a controller to connect.

> Q3
I'm not sure what you mean by BDE packages. Can you elaborate?


Best
Max

Subject: [stratum-dev] network topology with stratum switches
Message-ID: <CADbAsDgYdFyWBSPpMVANpckU93VE-VrmWjTPSHzRB0SpBminvg@mail.gmail.com>

Good afternoon,

I have to deploy a network topology for an ONOS controller and use P4 as
the language to create and send to the switches the flow rules. Since that,
I need to deploy a topology with stratum/bmv2. Hence I was wondering how to
deploy the topology with those switches. Does it exist an API for python
through which writing a script that mininet can use to create the topology?
(So I am looking to something similar to this
http://mininet.org/api/annotated.html but for stratum/bmv2 switches).

Thankyou for your time and help,

Jacopo
